# The purpose of this quick exercise is to check that you have everything installed.
# 
# 1. Check that R And Rstudio is installed and that you know how to enter a command
#    Press control + Enter (Windows)
#    Press cmd + End (OSX)
x <- 1 + 1

# 2. Check that you installed some of the external packages
#    Run these commands
library(psych)
# if you get "Error in library(psych) : there is no package called ‘psych’"
# Then you need to install the psych package and probably other packages needed
# in this workshop
# Go to: https://github.com/jeromyanglim/introduction-to-r-one-day-workshop
