# The purpose of this quick exercise is to check that you have everything installed.
# Hopefully when you double click on this file, it has opened in RStudio.
# 
# 1. Check that R is installed and that you know how to enter a command
#    Move cursor to line below (i.e., x <- 1 + 1) and 
#    Press control + Enter (Windows)
#    Press cmd + End (OSX)
x <- 1 + 1
x


# 2. Check that you installed some of the external packages
#    Run this commands
library(psych)
# if you get "Error in library(psych) : there is no package called ‘psych’"
# Then you need to install the psych package and probably other packages needed
# in this workshop
# Go to: https://github.com/jeromyanglim/introduction-to-r-one-day-workshop
# and run the install.packages commands
# Alternatively, you can enter the package names manually into the package pane in RStudio
